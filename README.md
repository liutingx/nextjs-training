# Next JS Training with Liu Ting

> Builds a basic app on fetching users data and displaying it

## Setup

Run `npm install` in prompt

## Run in development

Run `npm run dev`

## Testing (21 Dec 2020)

### Why should we test

- to check on the results on different sets of data
- When we make new change/feature, we are confident that the previous iteration did not break

### How do we test?

- When an event is triggered, the loading spinner should be visible
- when user inputs a unit number, the dash will automatically be inserted
